# Thematic Frontend Task

This app has been developed, keeping in mind, the guidelines set down in the document provided along with the data.

The primary objectives of this application is to achieve the following:

-   Build a Filter configuration form that allows a user to create filters using column data.
-   Allow users to create, configure and delete filters based on the columns available in
    the data.
-   Allow users to rearrange the filters so they show up in a specific order using
    drag and drop functionality.

The current solution tries to achieve the above goals in the best possible way within the available timeframe.

## Base App Observations

1. The app is quite old and the dependencies were not up-to-date
2. The data received from the API may be better defined to match the feature requirements.

## Scope Reduction

Unit testing was left out due to scope and time constraints.
